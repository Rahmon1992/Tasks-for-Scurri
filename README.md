# Tasks-for-Scurri

1) Regarding small project which I am proud 
Once when I was working as Web Developer we had to add huge amount of data from Excells documents to MySQL database manually which would take weeks for this. Instead I wrote a small programm in python which easily imported all the data from excell sheets to MySQL.

2) Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
Solution in file onetohundred.py

3) Write a library that supports validating and formatting post codes for UK
Solution with tests in folder PostCodes
